# Lets talk about - Template

This is a adjustable template for slides created with HTML.

## Build your own slides

There are two options to build this with your own slides

- a) Use this package as dependency
  Check out my [example slides repo](https://github.com/tamino-martinius/lets-talk-about--example)
- b) Fork and modify this repo

## How to modify and run

- Configure your Theme with `styles.styl`.
- Add backgrounds to `assets/bg/<num>.jpg`.
- Set the number of background images with `styles.styl`.
  You can also select if you want them ordered or random.
- Add your slides to `index.pug`.
- Install all dependencies with `npm install`.
- Compile and preview the slides with `npm run start`.
